## 📝 Project Description 
This project is a **2D driving game** made with Pygame.  
You control a red car on a closed track, avoiding walls, passing checkpoints in order, and trying to beat your **best lap time**.  
Collisions with walls are handled with a **bounce effect** (the car is pushed back without rotating).  

This project helped me with [Driving AI - GA](https://github.com/Thibault-GAREL/AI_driving_genetic_version) and [Driving AI - DQL](https://github.com/Thibault-GAREL/AI_driving_DQN_version) ! I just change the control **ZQSD** to control by my AI.

## ⚙️ Features
  🚗 Car movement with acceleration, braking, and turning  

  🧱 Walls and **bounce collisions**  

  🎯 Checkpoints with lap validation  

  ⏱ Lap timing with best lap record  

  👁️ Visual sensor rays (blue lines) detecting distances to walls  

---

## Controls
- **Z** → Accelerate  
- **S** → Brake / Reverse  
- **Q** → Turn left  
- **D** → Turn right

## ⚙️ How it works

  🕹️ The player drives a red car through a circuit defined by walls.  

  🧭 The car must pass checkpoints in order. Completing a lap updates the lap counter and times.  

  💥 When the car collides with a wall, it bounces back without rotation.  

  👁️ Blue rays are sensors showing distance to the nearest wall (useful for AI extension later).  

---

## 🗺️ Schema  
💡 Track layout and checkpoints are hardcoded in the code as rectangles and circles.  

You can easily **customize the circuit** by editing the `walls` and `checkpoints` lists in `main.py`.
